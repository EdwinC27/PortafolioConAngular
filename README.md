# PORTFOLIO

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.


The purpose of this project is to showcase a selection of websites that I have created. The goal is to provide a sample of my skills and experience in web development. In this portfolio, you will be able to see some of the projects I have worked on and find direct links to each of them.


If you are interested in learning more about my skills and experience, I invite you to visit the link below, where you will find my portfolio displayed online:   [Here](https://portafolioedwincastillo.netlify.app/#/).

There, you will find details about the projects I have worked on, as well as information about the technologies and tools I have used to develop them.

I hope you enjoy reviewing my work and find some projects that are of interest to you. If you have any questions or are interested in working with me on a project, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am available to discuss any ideas or projects you may be considering.
